🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Tic Tac Toe Game App! 🎮

I've developed a Tic Tac Toe game app using Java in Android Studio. This classic game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three symbols to win the game. 🏆

🔄 Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Smooth turn-based gameplay where each player can strategize their moves.
Win Detection: Automatic detection of winning conditions, highlighting the winning combination.
Game Reset: Includes a reset option, allowing players to start a new game with a single tap.
This project was a fantastic way to deepen my understanding of Java and Android development, and I'm thrilled to have created a fun, user-friendly app. Looking forward to exploring more projects and challenges in mobile app development! 📱
